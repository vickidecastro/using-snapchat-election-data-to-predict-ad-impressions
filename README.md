# Using Snapchat Election Data to Predict Number of Impressions on Ads in 2020
## Background
The [Social Media Today](https://www.socialmediatoday.com/news/data-shows-snapchat-is-highly-influential-in-getting-younger-people-to-vote/578020/) article discusses how Snapchat has been a very influential platform in getting younger people to vote. Democracy Works revealed that 450,000 Snapchat users registered to vote using TurboVote, which was highly advertised on Snapchat in 2018. Around 57% of these 450,000 registered voters then voted in the US Midterm elections.

Political advertisements on Snapchat use different stickers, filters, and lenses to boost voting sentiment, along with providing an informative list of polling locations on Snap Maps. 

I found this topic particularly interesting in times like these, with the presidential debate happening just yesterdat, September 29, 2020. I was also interested in exploring which big name firms and organizations pay for political advertising on Snapchat. 

## Business Question
What factors help us increase the number of impressions we receive on our political advertisements?
