# Using Snapchat Election Data to Predict Number of Impressions on Ads in 2020
## Background
The [Social Media Today] (https://www.socialmediatoday.com/news/data-shows-snapchat-is-highly-influential-in-getting-younger-people-to-vote/578020/) article discusses how Snapchat has been a very influential platform in getting younger people to vote. Democracy Works revealed that 450,000 Snapchat users registered to vote using TurboVote, which was highly advertised on Snapchat in 2018. Around 57% of these 450,000 registered voters then voted in the US Midterm elections.

Political advertisements on Snapchat use different stickers, filters, and lenses to boost voting sentiment, along with providing an informative list of polling locations on Snap Maps. 

The election data provided by Snapchat includes information on ad impressions, start date, end date, organization name, candidate ballot information, paying advertiser name, region, gender, and age bracket, as well as many other variables. The Snapchat readme file contains descriptive information on each of the variables included in the election data.
